# Intro to Python

This is the landing page for the Intro to Python workshop held by Yale's Cushing/Whitney Medical Library. If you have any questions about this class or the content, email medicaldata@yale.edu. 


### Running the Workshop Notebook in Google Colab

There are two notebooks associated with this class. These notebooks will allow you to use Python in your web browser. Since these notebooks will run in your web browser and not on your local machine, a Python installation is not nessissary in order to participate in this class.

### Installing Python
 
##### Standard Python Installs
* Learn more [at realpython.com](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
* Packages are commonly installed using pip commands. Learn more about pip [here, also at realpython.com](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/)

##### If you are uncomfortable installing Python and Python packages, the easiest install can be performed through Anaconda
* [Install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).



### Running Python in Environments Outside of Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab

##### Interactive Development Environments (IDE)
* PyCharm (the Community Edition is free to use)
* Spyder

##### Command Line Interface Options
* Terminal (Mac), or Command Line (Windows)
* Python Interpreter 


### Webguides, Tutorials, and eBooks for Further Learning
* [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/intro/learning/)
* [LearnPython.org](learnpython.org)
* [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/): This tutorial, which is a part of the python documentation, introduces manhy of Python's most noteworth features, and will give you a good idea of the language's flavor and style.
